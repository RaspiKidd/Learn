## Using the micro:bit

When the micro:bit first starts we will need to calibrate the compass by lighting up all the LEDs on the matrix.

Shake the micro:bit to display the temperature on the LED matrix.

Press the A button to read the light level. You will see a smiley face if in low light and the LED matrix will remain blank if the light level is high.

Press the B button to display the compass reading. This will be in degrees.
