Within the micro:bit simulator you will see that the pins light up red as the code is switching between them.

## Using the micro:bit

Once the code is dowloaded to the micro:bit you should see the LEDs light up in the pattern of traffic lights. If the LEDs aren't lighting up try pushing the copper tape/foil on to the leg to get a better connection.

If you find they are turning on/off in the wrong order check the pin numbering within the code.

P0 = red
P1 = yellow
P2 = green

You can also change the speed that the LEDs turn on and off by changing the timing of the pause blocks.
