Well done you have created your very own FitBit clone step counter.

## Web Browser

Using the micro:bit simulator you can drag the mouse over it and see it move or there is a dot with **shake** next to it, you can select this and it will simulate a shake.

## Using the micro:bit

Once you have downloaded the code to your micro:bit you can shake the micro:bit and see your steps add up. To make this more realistic find a way to strap the micro:bit to your leg or shoes and go for a walk and see how many steps you have done at the end.
