Now that we have the completed code we can test it out.

## Web Browser

### Temperature Sensing

Within the micro:bit simulator we can move the micro:bit around to simulate a shake or select the circle next to the **shake** text. This will display the temperature on the screen.

You will also see a slider with a temperature reading next to it. We can move this up or down to set our temperature.

### Light Sensing

Select the **A** button to show the amount of light being detected. Above the A button you will see a cirlce appear. You can drag the yellow part up and down to adjust the light level and when the A button is pressed it will be depicted on the LED matrix.

### Compass Sensing

To see what direction you are facing select the **B** button. A number of degrees will scroll across the LED matrix. To change the compass value move the micro:bit logo around (looks like two eyes).

## Using the micro:bit

### Temperature Sensing

Shake the micro:bit to get the temperature reading to show on screen.

### Light Sensing

Press the A button to get a light level reading

### Compass Sensing

Press the B button to get a reading from the compass.

:::info[NOTE]
If you are using the compass for the first time, you will get a message to move the micro:bit around to light every LED up on the LED matrix. This is to callibrate the micro:bit to get an accutate as possible compass reading.

Now go around different room/outdoors to see the difference in temperature and light level.
