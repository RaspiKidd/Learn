## Using the Web Browser

You will see that two micro:bit appear within the micro:bit simulator. Press the **shake** button on one and see the micro:bit appear on the other. Press **shake** on the micro:bit where the **ghost** is and see it land on the other micro:bit.

## Using the micro:bit

When you shake one micro:bit, the ghost displayed on its LED screen will vanish and mysteriously appear on the other micro:bit's display. It's like playing a game of supernatural catch!

Grab a friend and have a go.
