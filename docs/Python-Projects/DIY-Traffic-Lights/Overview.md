## Overview

In this exciting project, we will transform everyday materials into a working traffic light system! Using cardboard, copper tape/Aluminium foil, and LEDs connected to a micro:bit, you will build your own traffic light controller from scratch.

## What you will Learn

By the end of this project, you will understand:

- [ ] How LEDs work and how to connect them safely
- [ ] How to create circuits using copper tape
- [ ] How to program light sequences using a micro:bit
- [ ] The basics of traffic light systems

## What you will Need

- 1 x Red LED
- 1 x Yellow LED
- 1 x Green LED
- 1 x Piece of cardboard
- Copper tape / aluminium foil and glue
- 4 x Crocodile / alligator leads
- 1 x micro:bit (version 1 and 2 will work)
- 1 x Micro USB cable
- 1 x Battery pack for the micro:bit (optional)

Let's move on and create our circuit.
