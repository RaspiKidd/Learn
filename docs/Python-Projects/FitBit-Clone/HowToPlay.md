Well done you have created your own Step Counter for the micro:bit.

## Web Browser

The Python Editor has a built-in micro:bit simulator so you can use this if you don't have a micro:bit handy.

Under the micro:bit simulator you will see that the shake function is selected and if you click on the play button next to it this will simulate the micro:bit being shaken and display the number of steps on the LED matrix.

## Using the micro:bit

Once you have downloaded the code to your micro:bit you can shake the micro:bit and see your steps add up.

Find a way to attach the micro:bit to you and go outside for a walk or a run and see how many steps you have done at the end.
